# Introduction

This manual is a PDF document compiled from several reference files as well as help documentation for the PSAutoLab module's commands. The goal is to provide a single source for all documentation. Many of the source files contain internal cross-references. Best efforts have been made to port those links in this PDF file. External links should work as expected.

Note that the terms *Autolab* and *PSAutoLab* are used interchangeably but generally refer to the same thing. Technically, _PSAutoLab_ is the name of the PowerShell module that manages the _Autolab_ configuration which in turn is managed by the Lability module "under the hood".
