# Introduction

This manual is a PDF document compiled from several reference files as well as help documentation for the PSAutoLab module's commands. The goal is to provide a single source for all documentation. Many of the source files contain internal cross-references. Best efforts have been made to port those links in this PDF file, but there is no guarantee they will work. External links to sites like GitHub should work as expected.

Note that the terms *Autolab* and *PSAutoLab* are used interchangeably but generally refer to the same thing. Technically, *PSAutoLab* is the name of the PowerShell module that manages the *Autolab* configuration which in turn is managed by the Lability module "under the hood".

You can always read the most current documentation in the module's repository at [https://github.com/pluralsight/PS-AutoLab-Env]( https://github.com/pluralsight/PS-AutoLab-Env)
