    This is the Setup-Lab script. This script will perform the following:
    * Run the configs to generate the required .mof files
    Note! - If there is an error creating the .mofs, the setup will fail
    
    * Run the lab setup
    Note! If this is the first time you have run this, it can take several
    hours to download the .ISO's and resources.
    This only occurs the first time.

    **Possible problem, if the downloads finish but the script doesn't continue (pauses)
        Hit the return key once and it will continue

    *You will be able to wipe and rebuild this lab without needing to perform
    the downloads again.

    Note! You will need to provide an Administrator password TWICE - on for the config, one for the localmachine account.

    Next Steps:
    When complete, run:
    .\Run-Lab.ps1

    To stop the lab VM's:
    .\Shutdown-lab.ps1
    
    When the configurations have finished, you can checkpoint the VM's with:
    .\Snapshot-Lab.ps1

    To quickly rebuild the labs from the checkpoint, run:
    .\Refresh-Lab.ps1

    To destroy the lab to build again:
    .\Wipe-Lab.ps1

    To enable Internet access for the VM's, run:
    .\Enable-Internet.ps1
